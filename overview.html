<div class="wrapper overview">
<p>Stephenie Meyer is an author who's claim to fame is authoring the Twilight Series that would later on become a huge blockbuster success and help the careers of actors such as Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.</p>
<p>I remember being in love with her website layout when I was in seventh grade and it still in the same format despite the growth in web design since close to a decade. She also has too much information for a simple author site. Her information is also out of date and some of her updates date back to 2005.</p>
<p>She doesn't have a singular design and it changes as she click on random pages. It's also hard to navigate from book to movie information.</p>
<p>I decided to tackle this project by first seeing what her competition is doing and what makes it successful. I realized that portfolio sites need to be simple and the information readily available. By cutting wordy information and grouping information together, I ensure a better guest experience as well as an easier way to update to their website.</p>
